## Sharing

If you see a yellow item and feel your setup fits in, please **MAIL** one of the authors the output of the below links. Feel free to create a PR if you follow the below privacy hint:

They should al start with `<xml` and copied as plain text (i.e. not preformatted like Chrome and Safari do).
Either use wget/curl or use your 'developer view' from your browser to copy the source text.

## Important

Don't commit test-data in `tests` that shouldn't be available to 'the internet'.
To prevent this we've included a pre-commit hook that checks and validates that no private information is there (but do double-check yourselves!)
See 'scripts/pre-commit.sh' for details

### Obfuscating mac-addresses

We used to obfuscate them as they weren't used within our module nor HomeAssistant.
From v0.16.4 this was changed as such we recommend leaving them in, if you do wish to obfuscate
Note: Zigbee mac addresses are 64bit (not 48bit like Ethernet mac addresses)

Prefix:

- `ABCD01234567`

Postfix:

- Anything you'd normally have (last 4 digits can remain)
- When standardizing:
  - 0001 = Network Mac Address
  - 0101 = Controller Zigbee Mac Address
  - 0Axx = Nodes Zigbee mac addresses
